#Implement Verbose
    #In stats
#Implement WARNINGS, ERRORS
#Create a setting class
#Improve makefile
#Set sefault tabletopgames_path
#Check that exceptions call destructor
#Learn how to debug memory on VS Code
#Make script for debugging (which loads in VERBOSE as well as other setting)
#Create default constructor stats
#Create copy constructor stats
##Create constructor that doesnt take in a list? That would imply that we bridge the external nature of stat allocation into the stats class function itself
#Change .txt setting to .ini? (or implement some .ini settings)
#Verify if destructor is called upon throw
